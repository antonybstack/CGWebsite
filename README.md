# CGWebsite
This is my web app I have been developing for the past semester. I developed this for my client Bryson Goins. He is my roomate who owns an esports company, and needed a website to represent his company. The website presents information to any user interested in learning more about his esports company.

* Interactivity
  * 1 Jquery UI widget
Used the jQuery UI ‘Accordion’ widget which is used to group content into separate panels that can be open or closed based on interaction from user end.
  * 2 query Plugins
Carousel jQuery plugin called ‘Slick’. A slideshow of images infinitely loops through, and the user has an option to click through them too. 
A parallax hover tilt effect jQuery plugin called ‘Tilt.js’. It is responsive to the user’s mouse movement and animates a container to move as the user hovers over it with their mouse.
  * 2 Ajax requests 
An api call using Ajax request, which GETs data about an xbox, ps4, or pc player on Call of Duty Modern Warfare, and displays statistics about their player account.
An api call using Ajax request which GETs images/gifs from a json file stored locally.
